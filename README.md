# Monster Tracker

## Why This Page Exists
Once upon a time in a not-so-far-away land of programming and energy drinks, two friends, Kuba and Janek, faced a mighty dilemma that would put their memory to the test. Despite their sharp coding skills, they somehow couldn't keep track of a simple task: whose turn was it to buy the next can of Monster Energy? Battles were almost fought, friendships were on the line, and cans were left unbought. This chaos led to the birth of the "Monster Tracker" â€“ a legendary page that saves the day by remembering so they don't have to.

## What It Does
This high-tech (okay, not that high-tech) solution features a single, powerful button on a webpage hosted graciously by GitHub Pages. When either of the pals buys a Monster, they triumphantly click the button which then heroically toggles who's the next in line to make the purchase. It uses the mystical powers of `localStorage` to remember this crucial piece of information, thereby preventing any potential caffeinated beverage-related conflicts between the friends.

## Conclusion
Monster Tracker isn't just a page; it's a peacekeeper, a reminder, and a testament to solving real-world problems with code. For every coder who ever forgot whose turn it was to refuel the coding session, this one's for you!

Remember, with great power (and great caffeine) comes great responsibility!
